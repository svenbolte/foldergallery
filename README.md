# Import Bookmarks
Import browser bookmarks into WordPress.
Export bookmarks from your browser and import them as a list in a WordPress post. Supports Custom Post Types and Post Formats.

## Usage
In WP Admin, head over to *Import > Import Bookmarks*, select a bookmarks file (in **HTML format**, as exported from your browser of choice) to upload, and choose the destination post type and status.

### Custom Post Types
Bookmarks can be added as regular Post or instances of a Custom Post Type.
This plugin, on its own, will **not** register a new Custom Post Type (nor modify existing ones).

### Post Statuses
Newly added bookmarks can be marked "Published," "Draft," "Pending review" or "Private."

### Post Formats
Newly added bookmarks can be given any [Post Format](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/post-formats/). Note: it's your active theme that decides what this means for your site. If unsure, you'll probably want to use either "Link" or "Standard." Lastly, *only Post Types that support Post Formats are actually affected*.

### Dates and Archives
**Post dates** are set to the date the bookmark was created. Monthly archives, etc., work just fine.
**Duplicated entries** are not (yet) detected.
A **possible use case** would be to periodically "dump" all of your bookmarks into a WordPress-powered "linklog," then clear them all from your browserâ€”rinse, repeat. (However, if you *did* want to import the same link twice, e.g., with a different title, that would be perfectly fine.)

## Advanced: Modifying the Format of Imported Bookmarks
Use the `import_bookmarks_post_content` filter to **customize imported bookmarks' markup** with minimal PHP.
Some examples of what's possible. (These would typically go into your [child] theme's `functions.php`.) Note: core hooks like `publish_{$post->post_type}` allow even more customization, but that's outside the scope of this readme.

```
// Force open links in new tab.
add_filter( 'import_bookmarks_post_content', function( $post_content, $bookmark ) {
    $post_title    = sanitize_text_field( $bookmark['title'] );
    $post_content  = sanitize_text_field( $bookmark['note'] );
    $post_content .= "\n\n<a href='" . esc_url( $bookmark['uri'] ) .
        "' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>" . $post_title . '</a>';
    $post_content  = trim( $post_content );
    return $post_content;
}, 10, 2 );
```

```
// Do something else entirely.
add_filter( 'import_bookmarks_post_content', function( $post_content, $bookmark ) {
    $post_content  = sanitize_text_field( $bookmark['title'] );
    $post_content .= "\n\n" . make_clickable( esc_url( $bookmark['uri'] ) );
    $post_content  = trim( $post_content );
    return $post_content;
}, 10, 2 );
```
